# Contact Management API

A .NET 8 Web API project that allows users to register, authenticate, and manage their personal address book.  

This project was built as part of a .NET Technical Challenge and demonstrates user authentication with JWT tokens, secure password storage, and full CRUD operations for managing contacts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Register a new account
  - Sign in with existing credentials
  - JWT-based authentication for secure access  

- **Contact Management**
  - Add a contact (first name, last name, phone number, email, birthdate)
  - List all contacts
  - Retrieve a contact by ID
  - Update a contact
  - Delete a contact  

- **Additional Implemented Features**
  - Sorting by first name, last name, or birthdate  
  - Pagination for efficient listing  
  - Swagger documentation enabled  

- **Security**
  - Passwords hashed using `PasswordHasher`
  - JWT token expiration and validation  
  - Model validation for inputs (email, phone, password rules, birthdate check)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritaj19Zamel/ContactMangAPI.git
cd ContactMangAPI
```

### 2. Configure the Database
Update `appsettings.json` with your SQL Server connection string:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\ProjectModels;Database=AddressBookDb;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

### 3. Run Migrations
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at:
```
http://localhost:5052
https://localhost:7250
```

Swagger UI:
```
https://localhost:5001/swagger
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/users/register` â†’ Register a new account  
- `POST /api/users/login` â†’ Authenticate and receive JWT  

### Contacts (requires JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- `POST /api/contacts` â†’ Add a new contact  
- `GET /api/contacts` â†’ List all contacts  
  - Supports sorting (`sortBy=FirstName|LastName|BirthDate`, `sortOrder=asc|desc`)  
  - Supports pagination (`pageNumber`, `pageSize`)  
- `GET /api/contacts/{id}` â†’ Get contact by ID  
- `PUT /api/contacts/{id}` â†’ Update a contact  
- `DELETE /api/contacts/{id}` â†’ Delete a contact  

---

## JWT Authentication

- After logging in, copy the returned JWT token.  
- In Postman, add it to your request headers:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-token-here>
```
